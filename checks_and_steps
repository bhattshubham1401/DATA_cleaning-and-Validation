checks

Reading parquet file and creating dataframe
finding all location id in dataframe
Null value check, Special character check, Duplicates check
Creation time relabeling
#Grid value reading round-off#

-> Creating dataframe of each location id
Creation time as index for time series data
status "P" data only
Error_reason = "No consumption" and unit = 0 
power factor imbalance
Frequency impbalance
missing data packets inbetween different intervals of time 
status "P",Error_reason ="Success still unit is wrong
Checking Condition which has no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
Meter Change this will impact on grid_reading_kwh
grid reading having decimals value for some interval of time
units derived from grid_reading_kwh
filling missing data with next unit

grid_reading_kwh (closing - opening)= -ve #grid reading got decrease

in resampling we can't (max-min) of grid_reading_kwh 


check neccesary
-> Taking only those records which contains status 'P'
-> Checking Meter features derived from Current ,Voltage and pf.
-> Checking Condition which has no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
-> Checking power factor imbalance.
-> Checking Current and voltage are same in contentious Reading packets.
-> How manage data in which data packet reading is greater than sanctioned load.
-> Meter Change
-> Load Change
-> Reading Calibration

voltage zero current is not zero can't happan
current zero but reading increasing contineously can't happan

rounding off grid reading
absolute consumption
