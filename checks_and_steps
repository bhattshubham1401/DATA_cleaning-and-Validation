checks

Reading parquet file and creating dataframe
finding all location id in dataframe
Null value check, Special character check
Creation time relabeling
#Grid value reading round-off#

-> Creating dataframe of each location id
Dropping Duplicates
Creation time as index
status "P" data only
Error_reason = "No consumption" and unit = 0 
power factor imbalance

Creating units column with help of resampling(with window of 15 min)
Assignment of null values


check neccesary
-> Taking only those records which contains status 'P'
-> Checking Meter features derived from Current ,Voltage and pf.
-> Checking Condition which has no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
-> Checking power factor imbalance.
-> Checking Current and voltage are same in contentious Reading packets.
-> How manage data in which data packet reading is greater than sanctioned load.
-> Meter Change
-> Load Change
-> Reading Calibration

voltage zero current is not zero can't happan
current zero but reading increasing contineously can't happan

rounding off grid reading
absolute consumption
