Steps

1-> Reading Data file and Creating dataframe
2-> finding all location id in dataframe and storing them
3->  ~status "P"
    ~ Null value check,
    ~ Special character check (for object type data columns)
    ~ Duplicates check
    ~ grid_reading round-off

checks
@reading
(for complete data)

# Data Status =="P"
# Error_reason='No comsumption' unit should be "0"
# Null value check
# Special character check (for object type data columns)
# cum_pf(Power factor) sould lies between (0,1)
# Frequency should lies between (50+-5)
# should we round_off grid_reading ?


@processing
at single location_id  
-> Creating dataframe of each location id
-> Creationas timestamp relabelling
-> Creation time as index for time series data

# checks with grid_reading_kwh
1-> Meter Change  (len(df['meter_sr_no])>1)
2-> Reading smaller than previous reading
    ~ Grid_reading_kwh (closing - opening) = -ve #grid reading got decrease
    ~ In resampling we can't (max-min) of grid_reading_kwh 














missing data packets inbetween different intervals of time 
status "P",Error_reason ="Success still unit is wrong
Checking Condition which has no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
Meter Change this will impact on grid_reading_kwh*
grid reading having decimals value for some interval of time
units derived from grid_reading_kwh
filling missing data with next unit


check neccesary
-> Taking only those records which contains status 'P'
-> Checking Meter features derived from Current ,Voltage and pf.
-> Checking Condition which has no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
-> Checking power factor imbalance.
-> Checking Current and voltage are same in contentious Reading packets.
-> How manage data in which data packet reading is greater than sanctioned load.
-> Meter Change
-> Load Change
-> Reading Calibration

voltage zero current is not zero can't happan
current zero but reading increasing contineously can't happan

rounding off grid reading
absolute consumption

#filling missing data
-> basic techniques 1. forward fill/backward fill
2 inear interpolation
3.rolling window
4. if seasonility is present we can fill previous year value

@advanced techniques
1. KNN interputor
2. iterative imputor/ mice (multiple imputation by Change in equation)

stationary check
