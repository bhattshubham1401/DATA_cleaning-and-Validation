@Steps

1-> Reading Data file and Creating dataframe
2-> finding all location id in dataframe and storing them

Checks
@Reading (for complete data)

# Data Status =="P"
# Error_reason='No consumption' unit should be "0"
# Null value check
# Special character check (for object type data columns)
# cum_pf(Power factor) should lies between (0,1)
# Frequency should lies between (50+-5)
# When voltage is 0 current should be zero too
# When voltage is 0 np value should increment
# Should we round_off grid_reading ? #(raw value will be more accurate while testing)


@Processing
at single location_id  
-> Creating dataframe of each location id
-> Creationas timestamp relabelling
-> Creation time as index for time series data

@ Checks with grid_reading_kwh
1-> Meter Change  (len(df['meter_sr_no])>1)
2-> Reading smaller than previous reading
    ~ Grid_reading_kwh (closing - opening) = -ve # Not possible
    ~ In resampling we can't (max-min) of grid_reading_kwh 



@ Challenges
Unresloved
# Meter Change -this will impact on grid_reading_kwh*

Resolved (for cross-validation with data)
# Absolute consumption check irregularity
# Missing data packets between different intervals of time 
# Status "P",Error_reason ="Success still unit is wrong
# Status "P",Error_reason ='no_consumption' still unit is not 0
# Checking Conditions which have no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
# Units are not accurate with reference to grid_reading_kwh(closing - opening)

@ Final Dataframe required parameters
1. Grid_reading_kwh
2. Units
3. R,Y,B voltage and current ?
4. PF, Frequency ?
5. location_id, site_id, meter_sr_no ?


@ Dealing with missing data
#Basic techniques 
1. filling with values
2. Replace with most frequent value
3. Mean / max / min
4. forward fill/backward fill ( rows or columns )
4. Interpolation
5. Rolling window
6. If seasonility is present we can fill previous year value

#Advanced techniques
1. KNN interruptor
2. iterative imputation/ mice (multiple imputation by Change in equation)

@Time series Stationary check
@Model testing

check necessary
-> Checking Meter features derived from Current ,Voltage and pf.
-> Checking Current and voltage are the same in continuous Reading packets.
-> Load Change
-> Reading Calibration
-> Voltage zero current is not zero can't happen
-> Current zero but reading increasing continuously can't happen
-> pf=1 no consumption or no load or ideal Condition
-> if instant_cum_KW active Power > instant_cum_KVA then power factor is -1.
