@Steps

1-> Reading Data file and Creating dataframe
2-> finding all location id in dataframe and storing them
3->  ~status "P"
    ~ Null value check,
    ~ Special character check (for object type data columns)
    ~ Duplicates check
    ~ grid_reading round-off

Checks
@Reading (for complete data)

# Data Status =="P"
# Error_reason='No comsumption' unit should be "0"
# Null value check
# Special character check (for object type data columns)
# cum_pf(Power factor) sould lies between (0,1)
# Frequency should lies between (50+-5)
# should we round_off grid_reading ? #(value is more accurate when testing)


@Processing
at single location_id  
-> Creating dataframe of each location id
-> Creationas timestamp relabelling
-> Creation time as index for time series data

@ Checks with grid_reading_kwh
1-> Meter Change  (len(df['meter_sr_no])>1)
2-> Reading smaller than previous reading
    ~ Grid_reading_kwh (closing - opening) = -ve #grid reading got decrease
    ~ In resampling we can't (max-min) of grid_reading_kwh 



@ Challanges
Unresloved
# Meter Change this will impact on grid_reading_kwh*

Resolved
# Absolute consumption check irregularity
# Missing data packets inbetween different intervals of time 
# Status "P",Error_reason ="Success still unit is wrong
# Status "P",Error_reason ='no_consumption' still unit is not 0
# Checking Condition which has no consumption but kWh and kVAh is increasing.
# Units are not accurate with refrence to grid_reading_kwh(closing - opening)

@ Final Dataframe required parameters
1. Grid_reading_kwh
2. Units
3. R,Y,B voltage and current ?
4. PF, Frequency ?
5. location_id, site_id, meter_sr_no ?


check neccesary
-> Checking Meter features derived from Current ,Voltage and pf.
-> Checking Current and voltage are same in contentious Reading packets.
-> Load Change
-> Reading Calibration
-> Voltage zero current is not zero can't happan
-> Current zero but reading increasing contineously can't happen
-> pf=1 no comsumption or no load or ideal Condition
-> if instant_cum_KW active Power > instant_cum_KVA then power factor is -1.

@ Dealing with missing data
#Basic techniques 
1. filling with values
2. Replace with most frequent value
3. Mean / max / min
4. forward fill/backward fill ( rows or columns )
4. Interpolation
5. Rolling window
6. If seasonility is present we can fill previous year value

#Advanced techniques
1. KNN interputor
2. iterative imputor/ mice (multiple imputation by Change in equation)

@Time series Stationary check
@Model testing
